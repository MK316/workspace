Accents influence the rhythm, stress, and melody of speech, and learners who adopt native-like intonation patterns are more likely to convey the intended meaning effectively. Native speakers are accustomed to hearing speech patterns specific to their language, and deviations from those patterns can sometimes cause difficulties in understanding.\n",
